# PenPaws
PenPaws is a mobile application and interactive platform that connects users to shelter animals in the local area to increase pet adoption rates and donations.

By allowing animal shelters to create profiles for their animals and post video and photo updates of the pets, the audience can follow their content and grow closer to them with each post. Within our app, we will provide features that allow users to directly donate with monthly subscriptions or one-time donations. Furthermore, users can also start the process of adoption by submitting a request below the profile of the dog to the associated shelter. As our convenient platform builds an emotional connection amongst the users and the shelter animals, users will be more prompted to contribute by donating to the pet shelter or adopting the pet. For the pet shelters to thank the users for supporting them, pet shelters will be required to provide periodic exclusive content for the contributing users.

In the summer of 2017, PenPaws’ business plan and pitch video entered Technovation, the world’s largest technology entrepreneurship competition for young women. With over 2000 submissions from 115 countries, PenPaws qualified for semifinals and ranked first in Taiwan.
